# NYTPhotoViewer+LifeCycle

NYTPhotoViewer is a slideshow and image viewer that includes double tap to zoom, captions, support for multiple images, interactive flick to dismiss, animated zooming presentation, and more. 

With LifeCycle delegation you can change your view acord to the gallery state. If you push from a UINavigationController you can hide statusBar to prevent overlap with close and share buttons.

## Implementation

NYTPhotoViewer has a very standard implementation using built-in frameworks. The viewer is a `UIViewController` and uses `UIViewController` transitioning APIs for the animated and interactive transitions, a `UIPageViewController` for horizontal swiping between images, and `UIScrollView` for image zooming. It is intended to be used without the need for subclassing, and as such it accepts model objects conforming to a `NYTPhoto` protocol and provides ample opportunity for customization via the `NYTPhotosViewControllerDelegate`. Since standard APIs are used, the client has full control over the transitions and customization of the `NYTPhotosViewController`.

## Usage

Usage is simple, with the option for more complicated customization when needed through a delegate relationship. In the most basic implementation, just initialize the view controller with an array of photo objects and present it as normal:

```objc
NYTPhotosViewController *photosViewController = [[NYTPhotosViewController alloc] initWithPhotos:photos];
[self presentViewController:photosViewController animated:YES completion:nil];
```

## Installation

NYTPhotoViewer is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod 'NYTPhotoViewer+LifeCycle'

## Requirements

This library requires a deployment target of iOS 7.0 or greater.

## Inspiration

NYTPhotoViewer draws feature inspiration from Facebook and Tweetbot's image viewers. If this implementation isn't to your liking, you may want to consider [JTSImageViewController](https://github.com/jaredsinclair/JTSImageViewController) or [IDMPhotoBrowser](https://github.com/ideaismobile/IDMPhotoBrowser).

## Swift

NYTPhotoViewer is written in Objective-C but is intended to be fully interoperable with Swift. Youâ€™ll need to include an [Objective-C bridging header](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html) like [this one from the sample Swift project](Example/NYTPhotoViewer-Swift/NYTPhotoViewer-Swift-Bridging-Header.h).

If you experience any interoperability difficulties, please open an issue or pull request and we will work to resolve it quickly.

## TODO

* Animate bounds changes like Tweetbot and Facebook.
* Publicly expose the data source property.
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support.
